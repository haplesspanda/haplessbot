# haplessbot

This Discord bot is a personal learning project and not particularly well-designed. Its featureset is not intended to be coherent and is just based on whatever seemed fun or interesting to me at the time.

## Setup

Add your Discord bot token to file `secret/token` and application ID to file `secret/application` and then run `main.go`.

Note the `--define_commands` flag is needed to setup commands at first or after making any updates to command definitions.
